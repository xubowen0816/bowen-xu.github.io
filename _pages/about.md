Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), where I work under the guidance of Professor [Bo Ji](https://people.cs.vt.edu/boji/index.html).

Previously, I completed my B.Eng. degree at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) (co-founded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences) in China. As an undergraduate research assistant in the [Intelligence, Information and Decision (IID) Lab](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/shaozy/lab.html), part of the [Network Intelligence Center (NICE)](https://nice.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), I was advised by [Prof. Ziyu Shao](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/shaozy/home.html). I also collaborated with Professor [Lei Ying](https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/)'s research group at the University of Michigan, focusing on online learning and control.

My research interests include Bandit & (Deep) Reinforcement Learning, Recommendation Systems, Large Language Models, Network Intelligence, Online Learning and Optimization, and AI for Science.

Currently, I am focusing on **LLM for Recommendation Systems (LLM4RS)** in collaboration with Amazon and Professor Dawei Zhou at Virginia Tech. My research topic is **Revolutionizing Recommender Systems with LLMs: A Dual Approach of Re-ranking and Black-box Prompt Optimization**.

As an undergraduate research assistant, I focused my research on the following topics:

* **[Constrained Personalized Federated Learning](https://xubowen0816.github.io/bowen-xu.github.io/research/Constrained_personalized_federated_learning/)**
* **[MaxWeight with Discounted UCB Algorithm](https://xubowen0816.github.io/bowen-xu.github.io/research/MaxWeight_with_discounted_UCB/)**
* **[Constrained GNN Bandit with Social Network](https://xubowen0816.github.io/bowen-xu.github.io/research/GNN_Bandits_with_Social_Network/)**

<!-- In conclusion, my research concentrates on implementing intelligent decision-making and efficient resource allocation using **Bandit & Reinforcement Learning** and **Online Learning and Optimization** algorithms, with applications in various areas including **Network Intelligence** and Communication Systems (particularly in resource-constrained scenarios) etc.

Additionally, I am interested in the mathematical interpretability of Deep Learning as well as the application of **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and Graph Neural Networks in AI for Science. -->
